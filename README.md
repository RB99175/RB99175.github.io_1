# Link - https://www.countryflags.io
- This link does not allow to copy the api direclty so used the link for 10 countries and flag  and created the object     array.

# Plan bronze
- Defined the project layout using piece of paper
- Looked around for API but since the website did not allow, used link instead.
- Creating an array of objects to get all the parameters like Country, Flag, and Images

# Plan Silver 
- Used console log to make sure array of object are populated correctly.
- Using the for loop functionality to populated option for the drop down menu
- Console log the results to make sure options are populated.
- Created a function option to populate the flag image, flag name and console log the output
- Created a grid item using div class and drop down options
- Used InnerHTML of the flag grid "div" with the flag grid item
- Declare the points using submit function which calculates the total score   and display the    message as per the defined string instead of calcuating     the score
- Created compare score function between object array and user score 
- Populated the score using modal popup ( alerts)

# Plan Gold
- Using CSS -style the game back, set the background. Make the page looks like a game page. 
- Added a new functionality - countdown timer that way user gets only 1 min to finish the game.
- Tested the game with users to make sure there is no issue.
- Get ready for presentation by thursday evening:)
