# Game : Welcome to the World Flag ( self-scoring)

# How to play this game
- User will see 10 grids each containg an image for a flag and a drop down menu containing all 10 countries names. 
- User needs to select the accurate country name which corresponde to that cell and keep moving on till the user is       done with all 10.
- At the end of the game, User needs to click on the " Get Results" button where the user will see the output.
- User can close the popup button and can play the game again


# Link - https://www.countryflags.io
- This link does not allow to copy the api direclty so used the link for 10 countries and flag and created the object array.

# Plan bronze
- Defined the project layout using piece of paper
- Looked around for API but since the website did not allow, used link       instead.
- Creating an array of objects to get all the parameters like Country, Flag, and Images

# Plan Silver 
- Used console log to make sure array of object are populated correctly
- Using the for loop functionality to populated option for the drop down      menu
- Console log the results to make sure options are populated.
- Created a function option to populate the flag image, flag name and         console log the output
- Created a grid item using div class and drop down options
- Used InnerHTML of the flag grid "div" with the flag grid item
- Declare the points using submit function which calculates the total score   and display the message as per the defined string instead of calcuating     the score
- Created compare score function between object array and user score 
- Populated the score using modal popup ( alerts)

# Plan Gold
- Using CSS style the game main page , add animation, design with some        backgrounds. Make it look like a game page 
- Need to look for a new functionality and add that to project which I have   not learned yet
- Will test the game inorder to make sure I add missing.
- Get ready for presentation by thursday evening:)
